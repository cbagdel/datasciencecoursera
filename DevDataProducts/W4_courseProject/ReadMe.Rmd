This Shiny App tries to visualize the iterations of a boosted model using Adaboost and 7 intermediate trees, based on rpart. 
At each iteration Adaboost algorithm gives more weight to the misclassified samples, such that the next tree model has a better chance of classifying them correctly. At the end the final boosted model aggreates all intermediate models. 

The user can select each intermediate model or the final boosted model simply using the radio button, and observe the nature of subsequent iterations.
